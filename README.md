In this project, I collected and researched data from the wire. Based on the data from my account, it was investigated in several ways - texting, monitoring of the chats themselves, and a follow-up survey of a person's chat room.

In the repository there is a file with the survey itself and also in the folder "vocabulary" there is a dictionary of stop words for the Ukrainian language.
