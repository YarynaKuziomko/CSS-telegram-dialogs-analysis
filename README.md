# CSS-telegram-dialogs-analysis
In this project, I collected and researched data from the telegram. Based on the data from my account, it was investigated in several ways - texting, monitoring of the chats themselves, and a follow-up survey of a person's chat room.

In the repository there is a file with the survey itself and also in the folder "dictionary" there is a dictionary of stopwords for the Ukrainian language.
